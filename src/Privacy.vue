          <b>Privacy Summary:</b> Beaver Notes is built to work without
          collecting your personal data. Notes and media are stored locally on
          your device and are never uploaded to Beaver servers. We do not use
          in-app trackers, advertising SDKs, or built-in synchronization.
          Limited personal data is processed only where strictly necessary, such
          as for Android closed beta access or accounts on our translation
          platform. Our website uses anonymized analytics with no cookies or
          personal identifiers. We follow GDPR-aligned data protection
          principles, including data minimization and transparency.

        <p class="text-base text-gray-800 dark:text-white py-4">
          <b>Desktop App (Beaver Notes):</b> Beaver Notes does not require user
          accounts and does not collect personal information through the app.
          All notes, media, and related data are stored locally on your device.
          The app does not include built-in synchronization, analytics, or data
          transmission to Beaver servers.
        </p>

        <p class="text-base text-gray-800 dark:text-white py-4">
          <b>Mobile App (Beaver Pocket):</b> Beaver Pocket follows the same
          local-first approach. The app does not collect personal information,
          does not include analytics SDKs, and does not transmit user data to
          Beaver servers. All content is stored locally on your device.
        </p>

        <p class="text-base text-gray-800 dark:text-white py-4">
          Any file synchronization occurs only through operating system–level or
          user-configured third-party cloud services (such as device backups or
          folder syncing). These services are not provided or controlled by
          Beaver, and any data processed by them is governed by the respective
          provider’s privacy policy.
        </p>

        <p class="text-base text-gray-800 dark:text-white py-4">
          Crash reports, if generated, are handled by the operating system or
          app distribution platform and are not sent directly to Beaver servers.
        </p>

        <p class="text-base text-gray-800 dark:text-white py-4">
          <b>App Store & Platform Analytics:</b> We may receive aggregated and
          anonymized statistics from app distribution platforms such as Google
          Play or the Apple App Store (for example, install counts or crash
          summaries). This data does not identify individual users and is
          subject to the respective platform’s privacy policy.

          by Umami. Umami does not use cookies and collects only anonymized,
          aggregate data such as page views and visit duration. No personally
          identifiable information is collected through website analytics.

          <b>Translation Platform (Beaver Traduora):</b> We operate a
          self-hosted instance of the Traduora translation platform for managing
          translations of Beaver apps and services. When you create an account,
          we process your email address and authentication credentials. Account
          data is stored on Beaver-controlled servers. Password handling and
          security follow Traduora’s standard implementation.

          <b>Android Closed Beta Emails:</b> We collect email addresses solely
          to manage access to the Android closed beta via Google Play. Emails
          are not used for marketing or communications. They are exported once
          to the Google Play Console and then deleted from our backend. No email
          data is retained once the project exits closed beta. The backend
